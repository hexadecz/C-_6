1. Create a class point that contains private data members x,y
coordinates, provide two constructors one default constructor and
the other accepts two parameters as the values for x and y initially,
then provide a function ToString that overrides the function
ToString inherited from class object that used to convert point to
string ,then create a class circle that inherited from class point that
contains radius data member, provide two constructors and also
ToString function.


2. Create a class Person, which has attributes ID, name, age, and
gender. It has methods: print personâ€™s data and calculateTax
(which returns 0). Create a class Employee, which inherits from
Person with an additional data member salary. It overrides the
method calculateTax which returns 10% from salary. Create a class
SalesMan, which inherits from Employee with an additional data
member commission. It overrides the method calculateTax which
return 15% from salary plus 10% from the commission.
